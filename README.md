# Medical-Database

# This project was built for a relational database course at the University of Houston. The roles of Nurse, Patient, Admin, and Doctor were all accounted for. Each role had their 
# own functions, such as reports, addition, delition and editing of prescriptions and appointments, patient histories, appointment histories, etc. 

#All code is in PHP and SQL
